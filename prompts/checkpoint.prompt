Great now is a great place to checkpoint.   Now let us fully understand this and create a SUMMARY.md file in each of the folders summarizing the folder/module content and all the work we have done so far.   Also then create a top level SUMMARY.md that captures the over all project summary, state and context so other developers can pick it up and continue.   Also generate a file called a NEXTSTEPS.md in the root of the project that captures all the work that is outstanding and what are good next steps to go about it.
